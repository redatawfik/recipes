Jelly can refer to a dessert made from gelatine or a fruit preserve similar to jam. The fruit preserve is made by cooking just the juice of the fruit with sugar; it sets because of the action of pectin. Pectin occurs naturally in fruit and, when cooked with sugar and the naturally-occurring acid in the fruit, thickens and sets the preserve. Be aware of the pectin content of the fruit you're using because the higher the pectin content, the better the set.
